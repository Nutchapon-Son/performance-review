# MBTI

### What is MBTI ?

The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#ref-1)

The test attempts to assign four categories:

1. Introversion (I) or Extraversion (E)
2. Sensing (S) or Intuition (N)
3. Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)
4. Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)
   
One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like "INFJ" or "ENFP"

### Cognitive Functions

Cognitive functions are the technical term for “Modes of processing information and making decisions based on your Myers-Briggs type.” Each type has four (out of a possible eight) cognitive functions, which they use in a specific order. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#ref-2)

1. **Dominant Function** is your most preferred and what gets you into a state of “flow”. A person's dominant function is their strongest and most well developed.
2. **Auxiliary Function** is your second-most preferred. This function supports the dominant function and promotes balance and personal growth.
3. **Tertiary Function** is your third most-preferred function. It provides relief and is a way you like to “play” and be creative. the tertiary function will always be weak. It's something you can not depend on.
4. **Inferior Function** is your fourth most-preferred function. It tends to be a weakness and is something you may be self-conscious about showing the outer world.

### Step to find out Cognitive Functions from your MBTI

1. Get your MBTI.
2. The 2nd and 3rd letter of your MBTI are called functions. the 4th letter is called attitudes.
3. Find the **Extroverted Function** by your attitude, then mark it with "e"
   - If your attitude is P, your Extroverted Function is the 1st function.
   - If your attitude is J, your Extroverted Function is the 2nd function.
4. The other function is the **Introverted Function**, then mark it with "i"
5. The function that has the mark that match your 1st letter of your MBTI is your **Dominant Function**
6. The other function is your **Auxiliary Function**
7. Flip your letter and the mark on **Auxiliary Function** to get your *Tertiary Function*
8. Flip your letter and the mark on **Dominant Function** to get your *Inferior Function*

### Example
We will use ENFP as an example
1. ENFP
2. N and F are the functions, P is the attitude.
3. N is the Extroverted Functions, mark with "e" (Ne)
4. F is the Introverted Functions, mark with "i" (Fi)
5. The **Dominant Function** is Ne
6. The **Auxiliary Function** is Fi
7. The **Tertiary Function** is Te
8. The **Inferior Function** is Si
